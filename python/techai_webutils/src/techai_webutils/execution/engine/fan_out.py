"""Async bounded-concurrency fan-out -- the Python analog of Go's ``engine.FanOut``.

Runs an async mapper over a batch of items with a concurrency cap, isolating each item's
failure so one bad item never aborts the batch (mirroring the Go engine's panic
isolation). Cancellation propagates: unlike a normal per-item error (captured as a
``StepResult(FAIL)``), ``asyncio.CancelledError`` is never swallowed. Results are returned
in item order, and the observer receives exactly one ``on_step_complete`` per item.
