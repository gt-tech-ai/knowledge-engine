"""run_job_group: run a phase's AnyJobs (parallel or serial) and merge their BatchResults.

The Python analog of Go ``engine.RunJobGroup`` — the mechanism the gate's phase runner uses:
parallel runs every job concurrently; serial runs them in order and stops after the first job
whose result has failures. Per-item step events are emitted by each job's own fan-out, so this
helper only executes + aggregates; it fires no observer events itself.

    running detached (orphaned tasks whose I/O would commit after the group "failed"); once every
