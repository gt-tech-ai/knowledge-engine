"""PooledExecutor: fan items out over a fixed pool of stateful workers built once from a factory.

Where ``fan_out`` (and ``AsyncioExecutor``/``RayExecutor``) drives a *stateless* per-item mapper,
``PooledExecutor`` drives a small pool of ``PooledWorker``s that each build their (expensive)
per-worker context ONCE and reuse it across every item routed to them — the distributed bulk lane's
per-worker client reuse, replacing the per-object client rebuild of the stateless-task
path. It reuses ``fan_out`` for the driver-side concerns (bounded concurrency, per-item isolation,
exactly-once observer, ordered ``BatchResult``) and adds only the build-once pool + round-robin
routing on top. It carries no ``ray`` import: the Ray actor pool plugs in behind the ``WorkerFactory``
seam (``real_ray_pool.ray_worker_factory``), so importing this module never pulls the optional Ray
dependency — exactly mirroring the ``RayExecutor`` / ``RayRuntime`` / ``RealRayRuntime`` split.
