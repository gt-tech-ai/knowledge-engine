"""Executor boundary: in-process (AsyncioExecutor) vs distributed (RayExecutor).

The ``Executor`` protocol lives in ``techai_webutils.core.interfaces.execution``; this package
holds its concrete implementations and the config-keyed ``executor_from_config`` factory.
``AsyncioExecutor`` is the in-process default; ``RayExecutor`` (backed by the ``RayRuntime`` seam)
is the distributed backend; ``PooledExecutor`` (backed by the ``PooledWorker`` seam) fans items over
a fixed pool of workers built once each (the bulk lane's per-worker client reuse). ``RealRayRuntime``
and ``real_ray_pool`` are intentionally *not* re-exported here — they are the only modules that import
the optional ``ray`` dependency, so they are imported lazily and importing this package never pulls Ray.
