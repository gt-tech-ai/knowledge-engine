"""Distributed Executor: fan items out to a Ray cluster, reusing fan_out's driver machinery.

``RayExecutor`` satisfies the ``Executor`` protocol (``core.interfaces.execution.Executor``) by
delegating the driver-side concerns — bounded concurrency, per-item isolation, exactly-once
observer, and ``BatchResult`` aggregation — to ``fan_out``, and dispatching each item to the
cluster through the injected ``RayRuntime`` seam. Callers swap it for ``AsyncioExecutor`` via
``executor_from_config`` without touching mapper code. It imports no ``ray`` — only the injected
runtime does — so importing this module never pulls the optional Ray dependency.
