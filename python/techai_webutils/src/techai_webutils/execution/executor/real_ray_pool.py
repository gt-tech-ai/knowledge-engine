"""Ray actor-pool backing for PooledExecutor: each PooledWorker slot is a Ray async actor.

Wraps a ray-free ``WorkerFactory`` so ``PooledExecutor``'s pool slots become Ray actors distributed
across the cluster, each building its (expensive) worker context ONCE on its own persistent event
loop and reusing it across every item routed to it — replacing the per-object client
rebuild of the stateless-task path (``RealRayRuntime`` + ``_run_mapper``). Imports ``ray`` (the
optional ``techai-webutils[ray]`` extra), so it is imported lazily by the bulk runner only when the
actor pool is configured; the default asyncio path never loads it. This mirrors the
``RayExecutor``/``RayRuntime``/``RealRayRuntime`` split: ``PooledExecutor`` + ``PooledWorker`` are
ray-free; only this module touches ``ray``.
