"""RealRayRuntime: the production RayRuntime backed by an actual Ray cluster.

Imports ``ray`` (the optional ``techai-webutils[ray]`` extra) and is imported lazily by
``executor_from_config`` only when ``ingestion.executor.kind: ray`` — so the default asyncio path
never loads Ray. Each ``submit`` schedules one Ray task that runs the async mapper to completion on
a worker via ``asyncio.run`` and awaits the resulting ObjectRef (Ray ObjectRefs are awaitable in
asyncio, giving driver-side concurrency bounded by ``fan_out``'s semaphore).
