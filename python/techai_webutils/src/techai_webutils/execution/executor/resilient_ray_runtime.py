"""ResilientRayRuntime: retry-with-backoff + logging decorator over the RayRuntime seam.

The Ray analogue of the client resilience decorators (e.g. ``clients/kb_ingestion.RetryingIngestor``):
a cold Ray Client connect can intermittently time out the head's per-connection client server
(head-side ``proxier`` "Timeout waiting for channel"), so this wraps the connect in
``retry_transient_async`` (tenacity exponential-backoff + jitter) and logs each attempt. It is
composed at ``executor_from_config`` OUTSIDE ``RealRayRuntime`` — resilience is a decorator, never
inlined into the runtime (ARCHITECTURE.md#decorators).

It touches no ``ray`` (it delegates to an inner ``RayRuntime``), so ``techai_webutils`` still imports
without the ray extra. The task ``submit`` itself is NOT retried here — ``RayExecutor``'s ``fan_out``
already isolates per-item failures; only the (idempotent) connect is retried.
