"""RayRuntime seam: dispatch one work item to a Ray cluster and await its StepResult.

The ``RayRuntime`` protocol carries no ``ray`` import, so ``techai_webutils`` type-checks and
imports without Ray installed; only ``RealRayRuntime`` (a separate module, imported lazily by
``executor_from_config``) touches ``ray``. This is what keeps Ray an optional dependency —
``RayExecutor`` depends on this protocol, never on ``ray`` itself.
