"""Job[T]: a discoverer-backed, parallelised, optionally-retried unit of work.

The Python analog of Go's ``job.Job[T]`` — discover work items, fan each one out through
a processor with bounded concurrency, and optionally retry on failure or downgrade
failures to warnings. Retry is internal and async (mirroring Go's ``retryDo``) so this
package never depends on ``foundation`` and stays core-only.
