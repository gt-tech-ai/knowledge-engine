"""Single-writer distributed-lock port.

Bedrock allows at most one concurrent ingestion job per KB, so only one worker may drive a sync
at a time. ``acquire()`` returns whether the caller won the lock; only the winner calls
``release()`` (a loser must never free the holder's lock). Implementations live in ``clients/lock/``
(``InMemoryLock`` for single-process / local; ``PostgresAdvisoryLock`` for cross-pod stage/prod; a
Redis backend is a sibling of the same abstraction).
