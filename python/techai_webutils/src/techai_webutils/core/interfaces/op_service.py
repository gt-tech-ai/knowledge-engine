"""OpService — the single-operation service contract (mirrors Go ``core/interfaces.OpService[A,R]``).

Unlike ``CrudService`` (five entity methods), an ``OpService`` exposes ONE decoratable ``run``
chokepoint; cross-cutting concerns (logging, timeout, recovery) wrap ``run`` rather than each
operation. Multi-operation services model their operations as a tagged union in the args and switch
on it inside ``run``. ``A`` is the operation argument type; ``R`` is the result type.
