    Workflows coordinate multiple operations across services, pipelines, repositories,

    Examples: Cache-aside pattern (check cache → compute → store), order fulfillment

    Phase 1: Single-execution orchestration with error handling.
    Phase 2+: Long-running workflows, saga patterns, state machines.
