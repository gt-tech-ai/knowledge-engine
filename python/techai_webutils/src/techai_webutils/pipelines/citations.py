"""Citation extraction from retrieved passages.

Builds a structured ``Citation`` for **every** retrieved passage (not only those the answer's ``[n]``
markers reference), one-to-one and in retrieval order. The generator numbers passages 1-based in the
prompt, so the answer's inline ``[n]`` marker resolves to this list's n-th entry — which is why all
retrieved passages are surfaced as potential citations, and why entries are never collapsed.
