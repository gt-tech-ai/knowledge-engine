"""Client-side adaptive throttler (Google SRE "Handling Overload").

Sheds a growing fraction of outbound requests locally when a backend's accept-rate drops,
protecting the backend from a client-side retry storm. Mirrors Go's
``foundation/resilience/adaptivethrottle``.

Compose it OUTERMOST of the retry budget (Throttle -> Retry -> op): a local rejection raises
``ThrottledError`` before op runs, so the inner retrier never retries a shed request -- the "not
retried" property the retry budget relies on.
