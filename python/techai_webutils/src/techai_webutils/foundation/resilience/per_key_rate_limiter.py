"""Process-local per-key fixed-window rate limiter (a generic send/throttle guard).

A fixed-window counter per key: at most ``max_per_window`` allowances per ``window_seconds`` (default
one hour). Process-local (per replica) — a shared/distributed limiter is a future enhancement. An
injected ``clock`` (default ``time.monotonic``) keeps the window behaviour unit-testable. Distinct from
the peer ``TokenBucketRateLimiter``, which is a single global bucket (no per-key keying).
