"""Request-hedging primitive: fire a backup attempt to cut tail latency.

The default ``Hedger`` backends. Mirrors Go's ``foundation/resilience/hedge``. Hedging
duplicates load and is only safe for idempotent/read-only operations, so it is DISABLED by
default and opted into per read path via configuration (``HedgeKind.DELAY``).

Unlike the Go primitive (whose ``func() error`` op cannot be cancelled), the asyncio backend
genuinely cancels the loser attempt once the first responder returns.
