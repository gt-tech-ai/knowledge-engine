"""Async retry decorator for transient errors using tenacity.

The async analog of ``retry.retry_transient`` (which wraps a *sync* callable and cannot
await a coroutine). Retries coroutines that raise transient ``AppError``s (TIMEOUT,
UNAVAILABLE); permanent errors are re-raised without retry. A transient error that carries a
server pushback (``details["retry_after_ms"]``, set by the gRPC boundary) waits at least that long,
capped at ``max_delay``.
