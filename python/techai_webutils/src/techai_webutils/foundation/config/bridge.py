"""YAML-to-environment variable bridge for Pydantic Settings integration.

This module bridges the gap between YAML configuration files and Pydantic Settings.
It loads the merged YAML configuration (``base.yaml`` + ``{env}.yaml`` overlay +
``secrets.yaml``) and exports every scalar leaf as a ``<PREFIX>_*`` environment variable,
allowing Pydantic Settings to consume them via its ``env_prefix`` behavior. The prefix
(default: none) and the env vars that select the overlay are the caller's
(``initialize_config(env_prefix=..., env_selectors=...)``).

Why this design:
  - Pydantic Settings reads from environment variables by default.
  - YAML provides the hierarchical, environment-layered config the Go services also use.
  - Exporting the whole tree as ``<PREFIX>_*`` env defaults mirrors Viper's ``AutomaticEnv`` +
    ``SetEnvPrefix`` in Go: the YAML supplies defaults, real env vars still win.
  - Environment variables always take precedence (12-factor app principle).
  - Idempotency ensures safe multi-call scenarios (tests, multi-module imports).

The env-var name for a YAML path is the dotted path upper-snake-cased behind the prefix
(``widget.size`` -> ``MYAPP_WIDGET_SIZE`` with prefix ``MYAPP``), matching the Pydantic field
names exactly. The prefix may be passed with or without its trailing underscore: ``MYAPP`` and
``MYAPP_`` both export ``MYAPP_*``, so a consumer can pass its settings' ``env_prefix`` verbatim.
Flattening the whole tree (rather than a hand-maintained path map) means a new config section is
exported without an edit here.

With no prefix the bridge writes bare names (``aws.region`` -> ``AWS_REGION``, ``debug`` ->
``DEBUG``) into ``os.environ``, where other libraries (boto, logging setups) and child processes also
read them, and ambient variables with those names (e.g. Kubernetes service links such as
``REDIS_PORT=tcp://...``) shadow the YAML. Prefer a consumer-specific prefix in deployments.

Usage:
    from techai_webutils.foundation.config.bridge import initialize_config

    # Early in application startup (before creating Settings instances)
    initialize_config("/path/to/config", env_prefix="MYAPP")

    # Now Pydantic Settings (env_prefix="MYAPP_") reads the MYAPP_* env vars set from YAML
    settings = MyAppSettings()

    are not representable as a single env-var override through this bridge, and no
