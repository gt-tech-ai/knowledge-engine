"""EventHandler decorator stack for a message handler coroutine (ARCHITECTURE.md#decorator-order).

Composes, outermost -> innermost, ``Dedup -> DeadLetter -> [Retry -> CircuitBreaker -> Timeout]
-> Handler``. Mirrors Go's ``clients/messaging/decorators.WrapHandler``. A message already
processed is skipped; one that still fails after retries is routed to the dead-letter queue and
acked when it lands there. Built from the existing foundation
primitives (``retry_transient_async`` + ``with_timeout`` + the circuit breaker) and the DLQ
facade, so the mechanism is composed once, not re-implemented.

Pair ``dedup`` with a ``dlq`` so a terminal failure is dead-lettered rather than skipped as a
duplicate on redrive.
