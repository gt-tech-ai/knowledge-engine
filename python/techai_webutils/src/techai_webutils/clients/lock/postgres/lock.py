"""Postgres advisory-lock backend for the cross-pod single-writer guard.

``PostgresAdvisoryLock`` owns ONE pinned asyncpg session and maps the ``DistributedLock`` protocol
onto session-scoped ``pg_try_advisory_lock`` / ``pg_advisory_unlock``. The session is opened lazily on
first ``acquire`` (so a Postgres blip at startup cannot fail the rest of the process's work) and held
for the process's life; if the process dies the session drops and Postgres releases the lock
automatically (no TTL). The lock is a two-int ``(classid, objid)`` — the caller's ``namespace`` plus a
signed-int32-folded crc32 of the caller's ``key``.

Cross-cutting concerns (logging, tracing, retry, circuit breaking) are layered by the generic
``clients/decorators`` proxies at the composition root; this class stays focused on the Postgres
mechanics and its connection lifecycle.
