"""In-memory ``MessageConsumer`` for no-infra builds/tests.

``InMemorySubscriber`` reads messages from an ``InMemoryBroker`` instead of SQS, so a worker can
build and unit-test the consume path with no ElasticMQ/SQS. Mirrors Go's ``messaging/memory``.
Owns no external resource; ``close`` stops the receive loop.
