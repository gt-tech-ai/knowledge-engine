"""``MessagingFactPublisher`` — bounded, batching, fail-open delivery of facts to a message queue.

``publish`` serializes each fact and enqueues it on an ``asyncio.Queue(maxsize=max_buffer)`` without
waiting; a full queue drops the fact and counts ``gen_ai_fact_dropped_total{reason="buffer_full"}``.
Inside the async context a sender task takes up to ten facts at a time (waiting at most
``flush_interval_s`` to fill a batch) and sends them with one ``publish_batch`` — one SQS
``SendMessageBatch``. The injected ``MessagePublisher`` carries its own retry, so this layer does not
retry: a failed batch is dropped and counted (``reason="publish_error"``). Exiting the context drains
the buffer within ``drain_timeout_s``; facts still buffered after it are counted (``reason="shutdown"``).
Once closing — after ``aclose`` begins, or after the sender task died unexpectedly (logged with its
exception) — ``publish`` drops and counts every fact (``reason="closed"``) instead of buffering it.
