"""Qdrant-backed VectorStore adapter (local-dev vector search).

Wraps ``qdrant_client.AsyncQdrantClient`` behind ``core.interfaces.vector_store.VectorStore``.
Collections are created lazily on first upsert (cosine distance, the configured dimension); the
per-point ``payload`` carries ``document_id`` + ``content`` + the entry metadata so a search hit can
be reconstructed into a ``VectorSearchResult`` without a second lookup.
