"""Unit tests for gRPC channel factory and server factory.

This file tests that the clients-layer gRPC abstractions create properly
configured servers and client channels with health checks, message size limits,
and custom target addresses.

# Test Coverage

The tests cover:
  - Server creation: default configuration produces a valid server
  - Health service: gRPC health service is registered on server creation
  - Server config: max message size defaults to 16 MB
  - Server config: custom port is accepted and stored
  - Client channel: creation and teardown without errors
  - Channel config: max message size defaults to 16 MB
  - Channel config: custom target address is accepted and stored

# Test Structure

Tests use pytest class-based organization grouped by component (server, client).
No mocking or external services are needed; tests validate configuration objects
and factory return values directly.

# Running Tests

Run with: pytest tests/python/test_clients/test_grpc.py
