          rising while it rejects, easing as it recovers. A static probability would either never
          protect or never let traffic back.

    What it tests:
        - With shedding disabled (rand always allows), a healthy run keeps the probability at
          zero, a failing run drives it positive, and a recovery run brings it back down.
