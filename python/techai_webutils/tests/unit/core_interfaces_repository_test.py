        **Why this test is important:**
          - Repository is the generic data-access contract every service depends on; an
            instantiable stub would let a partially-implemented repo reach the service layer
            and return None for reads or silently no-op writes, corrupting persistence
          - Forces concrete repos to implement the complete get/list/create/update/delete/exists
            surface before they can be constructed

        **What it tests:**
          - Instantiating Repository directly raises TypeError because its CRUD methods are

        """Test that the contract's get() is an awaitable that returns the entity a repo produces.

        **Why this test is important:**
          - get() is the primary read surface every service depends on; this confirms the contract
            exposes it as an awaitable whose resolved value reaches the caller unchanged, so a repo
            returning an entity is observed as that entity (not a coroutine or a truthy proxy)

        **What it tests:**
          - A spec'd Repository mock whose get() resolves to "entity-1" is awaited and yields
            "entity-1" through the contract

        **Why this test is important:**
          - list() is the contract's pagination surface; this confirms a repo can hand back a
            populated Page — the shape callers iterate — and that the awaited result preserves its
            items, so the generic paging signature is usable as defined

        **What it tests:**
          - A spec'd Repository mock whose list() resolves to a Page(items=["a"]) is awaited with a
            PageRequest and yields a Page whose items are ["a"]

          - create() is the write surface every service uses to persist new entities; this confirms
            the contract returns the persisted entity to the caller, so the create signature is
            honored end to end

        **Why this test is important:**
          - exists() is the cheap presence check callers use before reads/writes to avoid
            NotFoundError handling; this confirms the contract yields a real bool to the caller
            rather than a truthy proxy that could mislead branching logic

        **What it tests:**

          - Transaction is the handle that guarantees atomicity; an instantiable stub whose
            commit()/rollback() are no-ops would let writes appear committed while the database
            never durably persists them — a silent data-integrity failure
          - Forces every transaction implementation to supply real commit and rollback

            wrapper, so multi-step operations would lose all-or-nothing semantics
          - Forces every manager to implement real transaction lifecycle management
