            if it mangled the handler, every chain built on top would be wrong

        **Why this test is important:**
          - The one-middleware case proves the wrapper is actually invoked, not just
            stored; a chain that silently dropped its only middleware would disable
            cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging) without any error

        **Why this test is important:**
          - Middleware order is load-bearing behavior, not cosmetic: an auth check
            must wrap (run before) the handler it guards, and a recovery wrapper must
            sit outermost to catch everything inside. Reversed nesting would let a
            panic escape recovery or run business logic before authorization
          - This is the contract that mirrors the Go chain.go, so both stacks must agree

            single logical request keeps one ID across service hops. If the middleware
            generated a fresh UUID even when given one, traces would fragment at every

            primitive every framework adapter relies on to stash and later read the
            correlation ID. If the two disagreed, IDs set at the edge would be
            invisible to downstream logging
          - The test also exercises resetting the contextvar via the returned token,
            which is how the middleware avoids leaking IDs between requests
