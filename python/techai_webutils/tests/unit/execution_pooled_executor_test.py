"""Tests for PooledExecutor: build a per-worker context once, route items across a fixed pool.

Ray-free by design: PooledExecutor is the driver-side pool (build-once + round-robin routing) that
the Ray actor pool plugs into via the PooledWorker seam, so these unit tests drive it with a
pure-Python counting worker — the real Ray-actor behaviour is the integration test. PooledExecutor
must inherit fan_out's bounded-concurrency + per-item-isolation guarantees while building each
worker's (expensive) context exactly once and closing every built worker at the end.

          - _LazyWorker is the shared build-once primitive behind both pool paths; it is load-bearing
            in the Ray actor (real_ray_pool._WorkerActor), where an async actor runs its methods
            concurrently on one event loop. Without the lock, concurrent first-item calls each
            ``await factory()`` (the build yields on the S3-session open) and build a SECOND worker,
            orphaning the first's un-closed clients and defeating the reuse — the guarantee the Ray
            actor pool relies on. Ray-free so the guarantee runs in CI.

        **What it tests:**
          - 8 concurrent ``get()`` calls against a factory that yields mid-build invoke the factory
            exactly once and every caller receives the SAME worker instance.
