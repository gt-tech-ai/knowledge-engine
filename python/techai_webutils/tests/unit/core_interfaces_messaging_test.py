        **Why this test is important:**
          - Message is the envelope every SQS consumer reads; a mangled id breaks ack/dedup,
            a wrong topic misroutes the handler, and a corrupted payload poisons processing
          - The default empty metadata and zero timestamp are the documented baseline a
            consumer relies on when the broker supplies neither

        **What it tests:**
          - id, topic, and payload round-trip exactly, and omitting metadata/timestamp
            yields {} and 0 respectively

            tracing correlation and ordering/age decisions; dropping them would break
            observability and any time-based handling on the consumer side

          - MessagePublisher is the produce-side contract for the outbox/SQS path; an
            instantiable stub would accept publish() calls and silently drop events, so
            downstream services would never learn about documents, notifications, etc.
          - Forces every broker adapter to implement real single and batch publishing

        **What it tests:**
          - Instantiating MessagePublisher directly raises TypeError because publish() and
            publish_batch() are abstract

            subscribe() and never deliver messages to the handler, so queued work stalls
            with no error surfaced
          - Forces every consumer adapter to implement real subscription and graceful shutdown
