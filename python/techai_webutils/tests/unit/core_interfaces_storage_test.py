        **Why this test is important:**
          - StorageObject is the metadata record callers read when enumerating documents in S3;
            key drives later download/delete calls, size and content_type drive UI and parsing
            decisions, and etag underpins integrity/caching, so any field being dropped or
            swapped would misidentify or mishandle a stored document

        **What it tests:**
          - key, size, content_type, and etag are all stored and returned unchanged from
            construction

        """Test that the StorageClient ABC cannot be instantiated without its methods.

        **Why this test is important:**
          - StorageClient is the S3-compatible object-storage contract the document pipeline
            depends on; an instantiable stub would accept upload() and silently discard the
            binary, or return empty bytes from download(), losing user documents without error
          - Forces every storage backend to implement the full upload/download/delete/exists/
            presign_url/list_objects surface before it can be constructed

        **What it tests:**
          - Instantiating StorageClient directly raises TypeError because its object-storage
            methods are abstract
