        **Why this test is important:**
          - The envelope is the on-the-wire cache format; readers (and any
            external tooling) depend on it being parseable JSON with exactly
            these three keys
          - If encode dropped the version or stored the payload under the wrong
            key, every cached entry would become undecodable or silently wrong

        **What it tests:**
          - The output parses as JSON
          - data holds the original value verbatim and version is preserved

        **Why this test is important:**
          - cached_at is the basis for any age- or TTL-based reasoning about a
            cached entry; a stale or fabricated timestamp would make staleness
            checks meaningless
          - Confirms the stamp is taken at encode time, not hardcoded or zero

        **What it tests:**

        **Why this test is important:**
          - Redis (and other byte-oriented cache backends) store and return
            bytes; returning a str would force every caller to encode again or
            fail at the client boundary

            float

            callers that rely on sequence

            rejected rather than deserialized into the new shape
