"""PrometheusMetricsProvider creates metrics idempotently (get-or-create).

A second in-process init of the same metric name must reuse the existing collector instead of raising
prometheus_client's "Duplicated timeseries in CollectorRegistry" — so a supervised restart, a second
observer, or two tests in one interpreter no longer crash (audit #4). The global ``REGISTRY`` default
is kept, so the ``/metrics`` scrape is unaffected (R1).

          - get-or-create reuse is only safe for a genuinely identical metric; silently returning a
            collector with a different label set — or a different type entirely — would misreport or
            blow up at record time. A real same-name conflict must still surface prometheus's error

          - Re-creating a registered counter with different labels raises ValueError, and creating a
            gauge under a counter's name (type mismatch) also raises.
