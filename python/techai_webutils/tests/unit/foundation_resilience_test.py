"""Unit tests for resilience patterns.

This file tests that the retry decorator, circuit breaker, and async timeout
wrapper behave correctly under failure conditions, ensuring the platform
degrades gracefully and recovers automatically.

# Test Coverage

The tests cover:
  - Retry decorator: retries transient errors up to max_attempts then succeeds
  - Retry decorator: does not retry permanent errors
  - Retry decorator: raises the last error after exhausting all attempts
  - Circuit breaker: opens after reaching the failure threshold
  - Circuit breaker: allows calls when in closed state
  - Circuit breaker: resets failure count on success
  - Async timeout: returns result when function completes in time
  - Async timeout: raises TimeoutError when function exceeds deadline

# Test Structure

Tests use pytest class-based organization grouped by resilience pattern (retry,
circuit breaker, timeout). Async tests use the pytest-asyncio marker. No external
services are mocked; tests use controlled failure functions.
