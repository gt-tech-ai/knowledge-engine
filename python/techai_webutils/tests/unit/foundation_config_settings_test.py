"""Tests for Pydantic Settings mixins (DatabaseSettings, RedisSettings, etc.).

Why these tests are important:
  - Pydantic Settings is the runtime configuration system for all Python services
  - MRO conflicts can break mixin composition silently
  - Frozen settings prevent accidental mutations that cause race conditions
  - Field defaults must match config.yaml to work in all environments

      - These defaults are what a developer gets with no env vars set; they must
        match the Docker Compose Postgres so `search dev up` works out of the box
      - A drifted default (wrong port, user, or db name) would silently point
        local services at a nonexistent database
