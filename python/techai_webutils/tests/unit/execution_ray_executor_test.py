"""Tests for RayExecutor (distributed Executor) + the executor_from_config factory.

Ray-free by design: RayExecutor is driven through a generated mock of the ``RayRuntime`` seam, so
these unit tests never import ``ray`` (the real-Ray path is the integration test). RayExecutor must
satisfy the same ``Executor`` protocol as ``AsyncioExecutor`` and inherit ``fan_out``'s
bounded-concurrency + per-item-isolation guarantees, since callers swap the two behind one protocol.
