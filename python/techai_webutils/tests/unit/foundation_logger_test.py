"""Unit tests for structured logging.

This file tests that the foundation logger produces machine-readable JSON output
with correct log levels, timestamps, and injected context fields (e.g.,
correlation IDs) for observability and distributed tracing.

# Test Coverage

The tests cover:
  - Logger creation: configure_logging returns a usable logger instance
  - JSON output: logger produces valid JSON with event and key-value fields
  - Context binding: correlation_id propagates through bound context
  - Log level: level string is captured in output
  - Timestamps: every log entry includes a timestamp field

# Test Structure

Tests use pytest class-based organization with StringIO capture for log output
verification. No external services or mocking needed; tests validate the
structured output format directly.

# Running Tests

Run with: pytest tests/python/test_foundation/test_logger.py
