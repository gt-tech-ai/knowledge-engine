            were dropped or transposed, the wrong worker would run, run on the wrong cadence,
            or run with missing parameters
          - These three fields are the full contract the scheduler depends on

            empty dict, and the default must be a fresh per-instance mapping rather than a
            shared mutable default that one job could pollute for another
