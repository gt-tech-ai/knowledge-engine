"""Unit tests for the client-proxy decorators (Logging/Tracing/Retry/CircuitBreaker).

Covers transparent method/attribute forwarding, decorator-chain composition, and error propagation,
plus the async-first behaviour: an awaited failure is logged/traced, transient errors are retried
(permanent ones are not), and the breaker gates the awaited call. The ``mock_service`` fixture (in
``conftest.py``) is a ``MagicMock`` reproducing the canned returns the proxies forward.
