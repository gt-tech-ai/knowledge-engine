          - Retry budgets prevent infinite retry loops in distributed systems
          - Services must be allowed to retry up to the configured limit
          - Under-counting would deny legitimate retries, over-counting would cause retry storms

        **What it tests:**
          - consume() returns True for each attempt up to max_retries
          - All three attempts succeed when max_retries=3

        **Why this test is important:**
          - Exhausted budgets must halt retries to prevent cascading failures
          - Allowing retries beyond the budget would negate the protection mechanism
          - Downstream services rely on bounded retry counts for capacity planning

          - Second consume() returns False (budget exhausted with max_retries=1)

          - Observability systems report remaining budget for capacity monitoring

        **What it tests:**

        """Test that reset restores the budget to its original max_retries value.

        **Why this test is important:**
          - Long-lived services need to reset budgets between request cycles
          - Without reset, a single request's retries would exhaust the budget permanently
          - Reset enables reuse of budget instances across multiple operations
