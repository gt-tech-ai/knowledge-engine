          - Burst capacity handles legitimate traffic spikes without rejecting requests

        **Why this test is important:**
          - Denying excess requests prevents resource exhaustion on downstream services
          - Without denial, rate limiting would be ineffective against traffic spikes
          - Clients receiving denials can implement backoff or queue their requests

        **What it tests:**
          - First allow() returns True (consumes the single burst token)
          - Second allow() returns False (no tokens remaining)

        **Why this test is important:**
          - wait() provides a blocking alternative to allow() for queue-based consumers
          - Callers that can tolerate delay use wait() instead of failing immediately
          - The token refill mechanism must actually replenish tokens over time

          - Without refill, a single burst would permanently exhaust the limiter
