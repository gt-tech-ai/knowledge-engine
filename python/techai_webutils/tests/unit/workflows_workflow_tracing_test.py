          - A workflow orchestrates multiple pipeline steps; without a workflow span the trace has a
            blind spot between the RPC span and the per-step spans — orchestration cost is invisible and
            the step spans have no single workflow parent (the "full tracing" requirement fails).

        **What it tests:**
          - build().with_tracing(tracer) opens exactly one span on execute and returns the result.
