          - The batched KB-sync loop polls until terminal; a wrong terminal check would either spin
            forever (never terminal) or stop mid-sync (terminal too early), corrupting document status.
            STOPPING in particular is NON-terminal — treating it as terminal releases the single-writer
            lock while Bedrock still has an active job, causing a StartIngestionJob conflict loop (F1).

        **What it tests:**
          - COMPLETE, FAILED, and STOPPED are terminal; STARTING, IN_PROGRESS, and STOPPING are not.
