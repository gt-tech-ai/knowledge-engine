"""Tests for ResilientRayRuntime — the retry-with-backoff decorator over the RayRuntime seam.

Ray-free by design: ResilientRayRuntime wraps a generated mock of the ``RayRuntime`` seam, so these
unit tests never import ``ray`` (the real cold-connect flakiness is a staging concern, not a unit one).
The decorator's whole job is to turn a flaky cold connect into a reliable one and keep the task path
untouched, so the tests assert exactly that: the connect retries, an exhausted connect surfaces a
transient error, and ``submit`` connects-then-dispatches without retrying the task itself.
