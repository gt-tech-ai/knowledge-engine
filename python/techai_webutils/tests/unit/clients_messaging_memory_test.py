"""Tests for the in-memory messaging backend + its factory selection (D7).

The ``memory`` publisher/subscriber let a worker build and unit-test the SQS path with no
ElasticMQ/SQS — the stub-first property (charter §13.2). Parity with Go's ``messaging/memory``.
Publisher and subscriber connect only through a **shared broker instance** (not module-global
state), so two unrelated brokers are isolated under parallel test execution.

          the handler call, so a handler raising ``TimeoutError`` was silently swallowed while any
          other error crashed the loop — this locks the consistent drop-and-continue behavior.
