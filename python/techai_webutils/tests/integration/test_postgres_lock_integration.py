"""Integration tests for PostgresAdvisoryLock against a real Postgres (testcontainer).

Unit tests drive the lock against a mocked asyncpg connection; these prove the properties that only
real Postgres can demonstrate: cross-session mutual exclusion (one holder blocks contenders and a
``SingleWriterRunner`` skips), the namespace as a separate half of the lock identity, and the
crash-safe, no-TTL auto-release when the holding session is dropped. The ``postgres_dsn`` fixture runs
a ``postgres:16-alpine`` testcontainer.
