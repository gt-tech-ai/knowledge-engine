    **Why this test is important:**
      - The large-document lane never pulls the object through memory; it streams the
        real aiobotocore ``StreamingBody`` to a scratch file. That body is a wrapt proxy over
        aiohttp's ``ClientResponse`` — it exposes ``read(amt)``, not the sync botocore
        ``iter_chunks``, and its ``__aenter__`` yields the wrapped response. A unit mock cannot
        model those quirks, so only a real-store download proves the streaming read is correct;
        a regression to ``iter_chunks`` (or reading off the ``async with`` binding) fails here.

    **What it tests:**
      - A payload larger than the 1 MiB streaming chunk (forcing several ``read`` iterations plus a
        final partial read) is written to ``path`` exactly, byte-for-byte.
