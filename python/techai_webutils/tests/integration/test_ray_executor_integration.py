"""Integration tests: the Ray executors against a real local Ray cluster.

Unit tests drive the executors through mocks/fakes of their seams; these prove the real paths:

- ``RayExecutor`` + ``RealRayRuntime`` — a mapper is cloudpickled to a Ray worker, run there via
  ``asyncio.run``, and its StepResult returned (the stateless-task path).
- ``PooledExecutor`` + ``real_ray_pool`` — a ``WorkerFactory`` is cloudpickled to a Ray actor that
  builds its worker ONCE and reuses it across the items routed to it (the actor-pool path).

Both fan work across the cluster with the same BatchResult contract as the asyncio path, and a
worker-side exception surfaces as an isolated FAIL (real RayTaskError), not a batch abort.

# a reachable Ray cluster. This env guard (not the ``importorskip`` above, which only fires
# where ray is not installed at all) is what keeps the test out of CI and the default local
