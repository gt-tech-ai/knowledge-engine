"""De-risk probe: prove a Ray computation runs over a Ray TESTCONTAINER via the Ray JOBS API —
reliably, with no ``ray://`` client hang across the macOS/Docker boundary.

Ray deprecated the ``ray://`` client in favor of Ray Jobs; ``ray.init(address="ray://…")`` from a
macOS host hangs indefinitely (see the plan's ## Deviations). This probe validates the chosen
alternative: submit a job to ``rayproject/ray:2.56.1-py312`` via ``JobSubmissionClient`` (HTTP, the
dashboard/jobs port 8265), poll to a terminal ``JobStatus`` with a BOUNDED loop, and assert
``SUCCEEDED``. No ``ray://`` anywhere — the job's ``ray.init()`` runs on the cluster head INSIDE the
Linux container (where local ``ray.init`` is reliable). Skipped (never a hang, never a hard failure)
when Docker or the Ray image is unavailable.
