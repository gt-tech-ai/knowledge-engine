// TestRiverRuntime_UninitializedHealth tests that both health probes fail on a
// Runtime that holds no connection pool.
//
// Why this test is important:
//   - Liveness/Readiness back the worker's health endpoints; a Runtime whose pool was
//     never constructed must report unhealthy on both probes rather than pass a
//     probe against a nil pool and let Kubernetes route traffic to a dead replica.
//
// What it tests:
//   - On a zero-value Runtime (nil pool), Liveness and Readiness both return an error.
