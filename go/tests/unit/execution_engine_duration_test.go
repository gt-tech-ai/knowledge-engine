// --- FanOut duration stamping ---

// TestFanOut_StampsDurationWhenZero tests that FanOut measures each unit's
// wall-clock and stamps Duration when the producer left it at zero.
//
// Why this test is important:
//   - Per-unit durations are what the terminal UI and the CI step summary
//     report; if a producer that doesn't time itself were left at zero, every
//     such step would display 0s and the timing breakdown would be useless.
//
// What it tests:
//   - Every returned result whose fn did not set Duration comes back with a
//     positive Duration reflecting the elapsed time of the invocation.

}

// TestFanOut_PreservesNonZeroDuration tests that FanOut leaves a producer's own
// Duration untouched instead of overwriting it with the engine's measurement.
//
// Why this test is important:
//   - Some producers report a finer-grained, more meaningful duration than the
//     coarse slot-to-return wall-clock (e.g. excluding setup). Clobbering it
//     would discard the more accurate figure and mislead the timing report.
//
// What it tests:
//   - A result returned with a non-zero Duration is reported back verbatim,
//     not replaced by FanOut's measured elapsed.

// --- RunJobGroup duration backstop ---

// TestRunJobGroup_StampsDurationOnZeroResult tests that RunJobGroup backstops an
// untimed job result with the job-execute elapsed.
//
// Why this test is important:
//   - Single-op adapter jobs return a result without timing it themselves. If
//     RunJobGroup did not backstop the Duration, those phases would render 0s
//     in the run summary, making per-phase timing unreliable.
//
// What it tests:
//   - A job result that arrives with no Duration is reported with a positive
//     Duration drawn from the surrounding job.Execute elapsed.
func TestRunJobGroup_StampsDurationOnZeroResult(t *testing.T) {
	ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)

}

// TestRunJobGroup_PreservesNonZeroDuration tests that RunJobGroup's job-level
// backstop never clobbers a finer-grained duration already on a result.
//
// Why this test is important:
//   - FanOut stamps an accurate per-unit duration; the coarse job-execute
//     elapsed covers the whole job. Overwriting the per-unit value with the
//     job total would collapse multi-unit timing granularity to a single
//     number and misreport how long each unit actually took.
//
// What it tests:
//   - A result that already carries a non-zero Duration is reported unchanged,
//     not overwritten by the job-execute elapsed.

// TestRunJobGroup_StampsDurationOnErrorResult tests that the synthetic Fail
// result RunJobGroup builds when job.Execute errors is itself timed.
//
// Why this test is important:
//   - When a job's discovery or pre-execution fails, RunJobGroup fabricates a
//     single Fail result so the gate sees the failure. That synthetic result
//     must still carry a duration, or failed phases would render 0s and look
//     like they never ran — masking how long the failing work took.
//
// What it tests:
//   - An erroring job yields exactly one StatusFail result, and that result
//     comes back with a positive Duration.
