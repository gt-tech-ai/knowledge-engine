// TestConnectorSeams_MocksSatisfyContracts tests that the generated mocks for the connector-family
// read seam and its builder satisfy their core contracts.
//
// Why this test is important:
//   - ConnectorSource + SourceBuilder are the AWS-free, dependency-free core seams the pkg connector
//     family (S3 now; Salesforce/GDrive later) and the app connector service depend on; their shape and
//     their generated mocks must stay in lockstep so a consumer can be unit-tested against the mock.
//
// What it tests:
//   - The mockgen-generated MockConnectorSource / MockSourceBuilder are assignable to their core
//     interfaces and construct without panic.
