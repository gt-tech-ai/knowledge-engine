// TestReadThrough_SingleFlightCollapsesConcurrent tests that concurrent cache misses on the same key
// collapse via single-flight, so a cold key under a request stampede hits the backend far fewer times
// than the number of callers — not once per caller.
//
// Why this test is important:
//   - The whole point of caching a live DISTINCT / COUNT is to avoid recomputing it; without
//     single-flight, a burst of simultaneous misses (e.g. every keystroke from many users on a hot
//     prefix) would each fire the expensive backend load, defeating the cache exactly when it's
//     needed most. This proves the collapse holds.
//
// What it tests:
//   - 20 goroutines rendezvous at the pre-Do barrier and call ReadThrough with the same key while the
//     load is blocked; the load runs at least once but strictly fewer than 20 times (the stampede is
//     suppressed), and every caller receives the loaded result. Exactly-once is not asserted — see the
//     assertion comment for why it is inherently racy for a black-box goroutine stampede.

	// the previous version had: it gated `release` on a counter incremented in the goroutine BODY (before
	// ReadThrough even called Get), so a straggler could still be between that counter and Do when the
	// winner finished — and, with an always-miss mock, that straggler fired a SECOND load (flaky
