// Routing is what RunRouting drives: one relay pass over a routing sink with
// healthy routes and one broken route, and a way to read what each route
// received. The caller builds the relay, so this fixture depends only on core.
type Routing struct {
	// RunOnce runs one relay pass over lane, draining h.Store through the
	// routing sink under test.
	RunOnce func(ctx context.Context, lane string) error
	// Delivered returns the payloads that arrived at route's destination.
	Delivered func(ctx context.Context, route string) ([]string, error)
	// Broken is a route whose destination fails every send.
	Broken string
	// Healthy are routes whose destinations accept sends.
	Healthy []string
}

// RunRouting checks that one relay over a routing sink isolates destinations:
// it enqueues three rows per healthy route and two on the broken route in one
// lane, runs the relay once, and requires every healthy route to receive exactly
// its own payloads while only the broken route's rows stay pending.
//
// Why this check matters:
//   - One relay drains many event types; a missing or failing destination must
//     fail only its own rows, never stall or misdeliver the others.
//
// What it asserts:
//   - each healthy route received exactly its three payloads;
//   - the lane ends with exactly the broken route's two rows pending, none parked.
