// Mock generation for the Secrets Manager SDK-adapter seam. The API seam is EXPORTED so
// its mock lives in the external go/tests/mocks tree — never in-package — and a black-box
// test (go/tests/unit) drives Get's JSON-field extraction / not-found behavior through the
// exported New constructor without network access.
