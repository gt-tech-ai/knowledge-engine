// Package redis provides a Redis Pub/Sub messaging integration (publisher +
// subscriber) implementing the core MessagePublisher / MessageConsumer contracts
// over PUBLISH / SUBSCRIBE / PSUBSCRIBE. It shares an injected go-redis client
// (typically the cache tier's Cache.Client()) and never opens its own connection —
// a peer of the sqs and memory messaging backends.
