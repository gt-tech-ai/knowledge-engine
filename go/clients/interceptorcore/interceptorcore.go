// Package interceptorcore holds the framework-agnostic resilience decisions
// shared by the gRPC and Connect interceptor stacks. The two stacks keep their
// own packages — the two-stack split is intentional and stays — and each
// becomes a thin adapter that translates its framework's call signature and
// status codes to/from the primitives here. The retry classification, the
// circuit-breaker gate, the bulkhead load-shed decision, and the timeout
// classification therefore live once instead of being re-implemented per stack.
//
// The framework-specific pieces stay in the adapters: the call closure (which
// invokes the framework's next/invoker/streamer), the code map that decides
// which errors are permanent, and the construction of the framework's error
// (gRPC status vs Connect error). This package depends only on core/interfaces
// and the stdlib, so it sits cleanly in the clients tier below both stacks.

// Retry runs call under retrier, treating an error for which isPermanent reports

// the retry loop stops. A retryable error is retried until the retrier gives up,
// whereupon the retrier's error is returned as exhausted. On success both are nil.
//
// permanent and exhausted are mutually exclusive — a permanent error makes the
// retry closure report success to the retrier (so retryErr is nil), and an
// exhausted retry never sets permanent. The adapter maps permanent to a verbatim
// return and exhausted to its framework's Unavailable code. This is the exact
// classification both stacks' retry interceptors performed inline.
