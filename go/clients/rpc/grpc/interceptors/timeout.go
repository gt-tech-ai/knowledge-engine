// TimeoutClientInterceptor returns a client-side interceptor that enforces a

// (codes.DeadlineExceeded, reporting the elapsed time) from a caller-side
// cancellation (codes.Canceled): a fast-fail on an already-cancelled — or a
// shorter parent — context is NOT relabeled as a full <timeout> wait, which
// would corrupt latency diagnosis. Any other error is returned unchanged.

// TimeoutStreamClientInterceptor returns a client-side stream interceptor
// that bounds only how long stream *creation* (streamer, including any
// retries wrapped inside it per the canonical ordering) may take — NOT the
// stream's data lifetime. A unary-style whole-call deadline would be wrong
// here: a server-streaming RPC (e.g. a long RAG generation) can legitimately
// run far longer than a reasonable connect/open budget, and killing it at
// the open-timeout would cut off a healthy response.
//
// This races streamer against timeout in a background goroutine rather than
// deriving a deadline context to pass into streamer: a context.WithTimeout
// context handed to streamer becomes the resulting stream's context for its
// entire lifetime (gRPC ties a ClientStream to whatever context created it),
// so there would be no way to "stop enforcing" that deadline once the stream
// opens — the long-lived stream would still be killed when the nominal
// open-timeout elapsed. Instead, streamer is given a plain
// context.WithCancel derivative that carries no deadline of its own (so a
// successfully-opened stream behaves exactly like one created with the
// caller's own ctx for the rest of its life) and is canceled only if the
// open itself times out, so an abandoned in-flight open is torn down instead
// of leaking.
