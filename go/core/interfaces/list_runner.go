// ListRunner executes a resolved list query against one datastore entity. It is the
// EXECUTION seam of the list-query platform — the dual of QueryBackend (the query-LANGUAGE seam):
// QueryBackend folds the IR into predicates, ListRunner runs a composed query and returns typed rows.
//
// It is the single per-entity adapter the generic pagination template (foundation/listquery.Run)
// drives, so filter, sort, and keyset pagination are written ONCE in Run and every store's List is
// just "build the scoped base, hand it to Run." A runner is constructed per request over the
// request-scoped base query (tenant/workspace/clearance already applied); it applies the spec's
// resolved predicates + order + window on top and executes. Ent has no generic query interface, so
// the adapter is per-entity — but it is dumb and uniform (a codegen candidate).
//
// T is the entity row type (e.g. *ent.Document).

	// Count returns the number of rows matching the given resolved predicates over the scoped base

	// most `bound` rows (a LIMIT-bounded id fetch, O(bound)), so a per-page total_count never pays a
	// full-table COUNT on a huge set. The caller (foundation/listquery.Run) passes
	// count_cap+1 and turns an over-cap tally into an estimate; the runner just reports the bounded
	// tally.
