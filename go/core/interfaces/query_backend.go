// QueryBackend interprets the list-query IR (types.Filter / types.OrderField) into a concrete
// datastore query. It is the "algebra" of the multi-target query-compilation SDK:
// the shared fold in foundation/listquery walks the IR and calls these methods, and each
// datastore provides exactly one implementation (Ent now; Mongo/Elasticsearch/GORM future).
//
// Q is the backend's predicate node type (e.g. Ent's func(*sql.Selector), Mongo's bson.M); S is
// its sort node type. Q and S are separate type parameters because a filter and a sort are not
// the same structure in every datastore: Ent unifies both as func(*sql.Selector), but Mongo is
// a bson.M filter vs a bson.D sort, and Elasticsearch a query fragment vs a sort array. Keeping
// them distinct means the first non-SQL backend can model its sort natively without a breaking
// change to this core interface.

	// Clause interprets a single leaf comparison — storage column <op> value — into a predicate.

	Clause(col string, op types.FilterOperator, v any) Q

	// ExistsClause interprets a leaf comparison whose column lives on a JOINED table into a
	// correlated EXISTS predicate: the base row matches when a row in join.Table (correlated by
	// join.TargetKey = <base>.join.LocalKey) satisfies op/v on one of join.Columns (ORed when >1). It
	// never joins the base query, so scope/soft-delete/keyset are untouched. v is the parser-validated
	// operand (a scalar, or a []any for OpIn/OpNotIn), same as Clause.

	// Order interprets one sort directive — storage column, descending when desc — into a sort node.

	// OrderJoin interprets a sort directive whose column lives on a JOINED table into a sort
	// node that orders by a correlated subquery over join.Table (correlated by join.TargetKey =
	// <base>.join.LocalKey), one ORDER BY term per join.Columns entry (a member "name" over
	// first_name+last_name). Like ExistsClause it never joins the base query. Joined sorts always ride
	// the offset pager (keyset stays same-table), so no keyset-seek counterpart is needed.
	OrderJoin(join types.JoinTarget, desc bool) S

	// OrderOrdinal interprets a sort directive with a value ORDINAL into a sort node that
	// orders col by the given values' positions (`CASE col WHEN v0 THEN 0 … ELSE len END`), so an enum
	// column sorts by meaning (owner<editor<viewer) rather than alphabetically. values are the column's
	// DB values in ascending order. An ordinal sort is a custom sort (the offset pager); no keyset seek.
	OrderOrdinal(col string, values []string, desc bool) S

	// OrderDerived interprets a COMPUTED / CORRELATED sort directive into a sort node: a
	// correlated aggregate over a child table (d.Aggregate — a Documents/Members COUNT) or a
	// timestamp-plus-interval (d.Interval — a connector's Next Sync = last_sync_at + the schedule's
	// interval). Exactly one arm of d is set. Like OrderJoin it renders an ORDER BY over an expression /
	// correlated subquery and never joins the base query; a derived sort is a custom sort (the offset
	// pager), so there is no keyset-seek counterpart.
	OrderDerived(d types.DerivedSort, desc bool) S
