// BufferedMessage is one retained outbound frame in a ReplayBuffer: its per-connection
// monotonic message id and the opaque marshaled payload to resend verbatim on reconnect.
type BufferedMessage struct {
	// ID is the message's per-connection monotonic id (e.g. "msg-7").
	ID string
	// Payload is the marshaled frame to resend unchanged (encoding-independent bytes).
	Payload []byte

// ReplayBuffer buffers a keyed, ordered tail of recent outbound messages so a client whose socket
// briefly drops can be resent exactly the frames it missed (reconnect replay). It is the
// seam the WebSocket hub depends on; callers depend on this interface, never a concrete backend.
// Backends: clients/replaybuffer/memory (in-process, dev/single-replica — a reconnect lands on the
// same pod) and clients/replaybuffer/redis (cross-pod, staging/prod), selected by config via
// clients/replaybuffer.NewFromConfig (mirroring clients/lock).
//
// Ordering is INSERTION order, never a comparison of the opaque ids ("msg-10" sorts before "msg-9"
// lexically) — ReplayAfter/Prune locate an id by its position in the retained list, so callers must
// never assume the ids are numerically comparable.
type ReplayBuffer interface {
	// Append records payload (identified by msgID) as the newest entry under key, evicting the
	// oldest beyond the configured bound and refreshing the key's TTL.
	Append(ctx context.Context, key, msgID string, payload []byte) error

	// ReplayAfter returns the retained messages strictly after afterMsgID, in insertion order.
	// complete is true only when afterMsgID is a proven-gapless anchor — either present in the
	// retained window (a gapless tail follows, possibly empty when the caller is already caught up)
	// or exactly the low-water mark set by the last Prune. complete is false for anything else —
	// an evicted or unknown id, a TTL-expired or absent key, or an empty afterMsgID (a client that
	// received nothing; unreachable in practice) — so the caller must full-refresh, never replay a
	// possibly-gapped tail. complete=false is always the safe answer.
	ReplayAfter(
		ctx context.Context,
		key, afterMsgID string,
	) (msgs []BufferedMessage, complete bool, err error)

	// Prune drops every retained entry up to and including upToMsgID — a confirmed prefix the client
	// has acked — leaving the tail, and records upToMsgID as the new low-water mark. An upToMsgID not
	// in the retained window is a no-op.
	Prune(ctx context.Context, key, upToMsgID string) error

	// Delete removes the key's buffer entirely (e.g. after a successful replay).
	Delete(ctx context.Context, key string) error
