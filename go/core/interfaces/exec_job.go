// Runnable is a runner-less execution unit: in-process work (e.g. DB seeding) that
// needs neither a CommandRunner nor a filesystem root. Compose it into a gate with
// the execution adapter (job.Adapt), which lifts it to AnyJob — so callers build
// typed Runnables instead of passing a nil CommandRunner through the API.
