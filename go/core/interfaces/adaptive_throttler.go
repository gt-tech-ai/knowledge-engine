// AdaptiveThrottler applies client-side adaptive throttling (Google SRE "Handling Overload"):
// it tracks the recent accept/reject ratio and, when a backend starts failing, rejects a
// growing fraction of outbound requests locally — shedding load before it reaches the
// struggling backend and easing off as the backend recovers. It composes with the retry
// budget: a locally-throttled request is a terminal rejection, not retried.
//
// A peer resilience contract of Retrier and Bulkhead: it wraps an operation with a policy and
// depends on no concrete implementation. Swap implementations via the adaptivethrottle.New
// factory.
type AdaptiveThrottler interface {
	// Do runs op unless the throttler decides to reject it locally, in which case it returns a
	// coded "throttled" rejection (see adaptivethrottle) WITHOUT invoking op. Each op outcome
	// (accepted/rejected by the backend) feeds the accept-rate window that drives the decision.
