// ExecutionObserver receives lifecycle events from the execution engine.
// All methods are called synchronously, serialized on a single goroutine — the
// engine owns serialization (RunJobGroup/FanOut funnel concurrent results
// through one goroutine before delivering them here), so implementations need
// not lock for that reason; they still must not block.
//
// Lifecycle order per run: OnGateStart → (per phase: OnPhaseStart → per step:
// OnStepStart? → OnStepComplete) → OnPhaseComplete → … → OnGateComplete. The
// *Start events carry only the names known at that point (phase names at the
// gate, job names at the phase); OnStepStart is best-effort and may be omitted
// by producers that don't know a step's name before it runs.
