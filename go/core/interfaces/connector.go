// ConnectorSource is the connector-family read seam any connector type satisfies — an object store now
// (S3), a record system (Salesforce) or a file SaaS (GDrive/SharePoint) later. It is deliberately
// transport-agnostic and AWS-free so it lives in dependency-free core; the concrete S3/OAuth clients
// live in go/clients/connector/<type>. It exposes the two reads a connector needs: a bounded
// reachability probe (TestConnection, the "test" button) and the resumable, memory-bounded page-by-page
// listing the sync engine crawls (ListPage). It does NOT fetch or normalize object BODIES —
// that (parse + embed + ingest) is the Python (Ray) bulk pipeline downstream of the differ.

	// start of the listing) and returns the page plus the token to resume from ("" when the listing is

	// with — holding one page at a time (never the full key list) and checkpointing the token so a
	// crashed sync resumes from the last committed page rather than restarting a million-object crawl.
	// A non-positive limit lets the backend apply its default page size. A failure is a coded error
	// (transient CodeUnavailable vs terminal CodeInvalidInput) so the caller can classify retry-vs-fail.

	// could have the platform assume it for them (the confused-deputy problem).
