// Package entlist is the Ent glue shared by every app's ListRunner adapters: it folds a
// resolved-column ListSpec's predicates and ORDER BY into Ent query-node functions through the
// entcompiler QueryBackend. The per-entity adapters (which apply these to their typed *ent.XQuery and
// execute) live in each app's stores package because Ent has no generic query interface; only this
// backend-folding is app-agnostic, so it lives once here rather than duplicated per app module.
