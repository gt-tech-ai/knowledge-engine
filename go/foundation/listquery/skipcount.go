// only for its ONE inner List call when it already holds a cached total, so the expensive bounded
// count is not recomputed and the cached value is injected instead.
//
// It MUST be applied to a locally-derived child context passed ONLY into that one inner List call —
// never by reassigning/mutating the caller's own ctx — so the flag can never leak into a sibling
// List and silently zero a real total.

// to its inner List) can check it without depending on the private context key.
